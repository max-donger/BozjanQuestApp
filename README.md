When doing sprites u can reach both Earth Sprites within the 2 min respawn timer.
Lightning sprites with the Zadnor TP and lost impetus/haste
Even wind sprites work

Bozjan lexicon (abbrev)
CE/LFG/cluster farming/sprite farming/ fate/ castruml/CLL / Delubrum

TODO
- Sprite respawn times
- Explain timer reset when entering Castrum
- Explain Historian, and Marching Orders buff (adds a special extra buff if you get it). Also I never got Marching Orders for Castrum so far.
- Lockbox odds for the mount is about 2.5%?
- Golden mount from delubrum is like what, 10%? maybe 5%?
- Explain maximizing profit on doing fates, by pulling the 4th legion mobs towards them
- Dice LB3 is about 20% maybe? How many options are there? I've never gotten doom so far
- Add reset button to Star mob timers
- X Memories, and where to get them

If you haven't registered yet and you try to register you may get this:
You cannot join a critical engagement with less than 10 seconds remaining before battle.
Commencing does work.


maybe like 7 marching orders now and still no castrum priority



/sea to see player list


235 zadnor lockbox, only 1x 3 star (the hair twin)


Use Leaflet / Geoserver or something for the map?


Zadnor fates RDM > mammoth > chocobos > golem > bots
z3 fates reset with rdm, which slows down mamoth?
for timebomb one u can use lost reflect


Other websites that use Leaflet in a great way:

----

DPS build = Lost Assassination + Essence of the Beast. Ofc there is other builds but lets not get expensive
Cleaning Slash in Delubrum? Use the Resistance Medkit. You will need like 7?



----

Zadnor drops
Z2
All drop Moonlight except -> Zadnor Banshee =  care
even IV ape and Coeurl (just 1 too, maybe 2 and 3 too?)
IV Leshy drops 1 to 3 Moonlight. Can kill with 1 WAR, 1 Healer, 1 DPS but its super tough, need Lost Rampage and kiting a bit

Star mobs in z2 give 6-8? artistry

Water in z2 = 8 artistry (1 each) = 80k at 10k gil per fragment
Thunder IV too

---
Bozja drops

Z2
Wrights
bozja z2 Wrights
9 forgotten fragment of care

bozja z3 gravekeeper
9 forgotten fragment of violence

those z3 compassion drake (Monitor) nerfed into ground, whole ring 9? only drops 1 compassion

Goobbye drops nothing?

Rank V
Bojan Elasmoth (behemoths) = 1 compassion each
Bozjan Doll (tree) = 1 compassion each
Bozjan Anzu (bird) = 1 compassion each
Bozjan Rider (horse) = ??? (sleep immune!)


---

Add macros here
also dont forget about /macrocancel, maybe when mounting?

-----

Zadnor zone 3  Rank V golem on BLM?
mch with breahtaker and 16 lost focus stacks will hit rank V golem like 30%
blm lost flare star with banner will hit golem like 30%
But what about:

BLM - 

1. Use Deep Essence of the Platebearer
2. Use Lost Bubble, Lost Protect II, Lost Stoneskin
3. Attack nearby low level monster
4. Use Lost Excellence (65%), Lost Font of Magic (70%)
5. Use Lost Banner of Noble Ends  (50%)
6. Cast Lost Flare Star (350 potency, 60 seconds)
7. Sleep the monsters
Not included: Lost Bravery (5%)
Should be a 185% potency Lost Flare Star.
Is that almost 1000 potency per tick? (assuming its x2,85)

RDM can go way higher due to Lost Chainspell with no mana cost.
BLM could go Lost Chainspell, but Lost Flare Star is 9000 mana,
it might cost too much mana without Ordained.
Mana drain is ok cuz blm does have 1 mana gain skill.
As long as its within treshhold.


How to cluster farm:

Bozjan Southern Front
z3 2 nw rings of 4th legion, and all compassion plants
    WAR + 1 random role, Nascent Flash when pulling, then slash
    BLM + 1 random role. Can do Lost Cure III with triplecast
WAR with Lost Cure IV, Lost Slash/Lost Rampage, bloodsucker
, war can pull plants + left ring, random guy can pull both rings east except the most southern 2 mobs?
z2 worms + antlions
    WAR + 1 random role
WAR with Lost Cure IV, Lost Slash/Lost Rampage, bloodsucker
