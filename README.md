TODO
- Sprite respawn times
- Explain timer reset when entering Castrum
- Explain Historian, and Marching Orders buff (adds a special extra buff if you get it). Also I never got Marching Orders for Castrum so far.
- Lockbox odds for the mount is about 2.5%?
- Golden mount from delubrum is like what, 10%? maybe 5%?
- Explain maximizing profit on doing fates, by pulling the 4th legion mobs towards them
- Dice LB3 is about 20% maybe? How many options are there? I've never gotten doom so far


If you haven't registered yet and you try to register you may get this:
You cannot join a critical engagement with less than 10 seconds remaining before battle.
Commencing does work.


maybe like 7 marching orders now and still no castrum priority
